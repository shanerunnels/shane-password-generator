This was definitely a tougher project. Mostly because of my frustrations with JS. But I'll get a handle on it soon! I'm sure there are other, quicker ways to handle this project, but "this is the way" that works for me - Star Wars reference.
What was key for me was starting from the end and working my way back. I knew that there were functions that need to be executed, so I created those first. I decided that a while loop was great for the prompt, and I hid a movie reference in it. Points if you can guess the movie. I put all my confirms in functions to be executed at the end. I also put all the "math" in a seperate function that's invoked in the writePassword() function which is executed at the end. 

## What the employee desires
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Criteria 

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
